# Doss Lute
**Wondrous item, uncommon, requires attunement**

The Doss Lute is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary lute in every way. It is made of three kinds of wood, expertly blended together, in a textured pattern depicting a variety of forest animals.

A creature that attempts to play the Doss Lute without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage. After attuning to the Doss Lute, it may be used by a Bard as a spellcasting focus.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.

**Spells:**
• Animal Friendship
• Fly
• Invisibility
• Levitate
• Protection from Energy (fire only)
• Protection from Evil and Good
• Protection from Poison
